## TODO

- **onBoarding screen:** Add an onboarding screen when the app is launched.
- **Skip to the next track:** Currently the app doesn't allow going to the next track. Also the track does not change when the timer runs out.
- **Shared animations:** Add shared animation support between the screens.
